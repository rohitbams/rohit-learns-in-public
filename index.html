        <p>
            This will be my blog. Here I will post articles about the things I will learn. I will publish 
            my learnings and post them in various platforms like reddit. I will include topics from various 
            fields that interest me including programming, music, art, design, electronics, and much more.
        </p>
        <p> I hope to make this a very entertaining and informative blog that will be very easy to read/listen to.
            This was a first text-based test article that will help me test out the layout of this blog,
