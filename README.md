## What is Learning in Public?
This concept of learning in public was introduced by ____ person x, who created a blog documenting their learning process. I loved this concept when I heard about it from my brilliant sister, and very excitedly created a github repo to start document my own learining. However, I momentarily turned my attention to something else, and all of a sudden a year and a half had passed. In the middle of that time I moved to another country, started and finished a MSc program, became a vegan activist, built a complex real-time physically modelled harmonium synthesiser, moved to London into a house with other vegan activists, got a job and started making a shit-ton of money. Okay one of those things might be wishful thinking. However, I haven't added starting a band to that list yet, but I digress.
The idea of learing in public is to present to the world about all the cool technologies and skills you are learning and all the projects you are building, so that companies and recruiters think you are a great potential hire. This is of course a low-stakes portfolio project where you can showcase the projects that you haven't completed, but people found a way to Linkedin-ise this cool thing as well and made it a high-stakes  fancy tech-trend. I decided to take a very uncool approach however, and decided to showcase, at times rather embarrasingly and humblingly, just the little things that i am learning. These things range from basic/fundamental computer science concepts, cooking concepts, music theory concepts, (i need to stop repeating the word 'concepts' so much- argh did it again), topics related to veganism, music, film, creativity, London, India, the universe, etc. Basically all the topics (and concepts) that I find interesting and inspiring.
My learn in public is dedicated to my curiosity of the world, and in that it runs the risk of being as endless as the universe itself. I hope you find these musings just as amusing as I do. Have fun reading through!

## Design
The design for this blog is a simple neumorphic design that i really like. I love the making little shadow-bordered boxes with soft corners and a monochromatic layout. I think it looks very sleek and cool :)
This blog is mostly a static HTML/CSS website with some dynamic Javascript activity to keep the focus on the content of the blog posts.
