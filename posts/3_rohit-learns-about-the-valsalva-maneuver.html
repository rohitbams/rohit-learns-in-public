            okay this is so cool - the valsalva maneuver is that physical phenomenon that you feel when you take a deep breath 
            and you hold it, causing your vision and hearing to fade and increasing the pressure in your head. i always liked 
            doing this anytime i am just sitting by myself and my attention turns to my breathing. i've often wondered is doing 
            this deliberately is harmful, as holding your breath momentarily stops oxygen supply to your brain and heart - but 
            apparently it's not really that harmful (or at least that's what chatgpt says, and you know chatgpt never lies). 
            ah but to it's credit, chatgpt is legally obliged not to provide harmful advice so of course it told me to use 
            caution. however i started doing some real research (watching medical science youtube videos IS real research!) 
            and reading medical journals on the valsalva maneuver, and found some really cool and interesting things about it:
