        <!-- <h3>rohit learns c</h3> -->
        <main>
            <p> over the last few days i've been really interesting in pursuing embedded systems 
            as a career. since my masters did not have any module that went deep into embedded systems 
            (interactive hardware and software was not really an embedded systems module, it was a design module), 
            i decided to start learning it on my own. i learned that there are some common requirements in most entry 
            level embedded jobs;
            <ul>
                <li>c and c++</li>
                <li>FreeRTOs</li>
                <li>stm32</li>
            </ul>
            now two of these three things are kinda tricky, i don't have a readily available pc that i can 
            install FreeRTOs on (looking at you dell xps with the 4th dead battery), or an stm32 dev kit to start 
            developing on immediately. so my best option, and perhaps the most valuable option, is to start learning 
            c.
            </p>

            <p>
                up until now c seemed almost like a mythical language of the gods to me. it felt too unapproachable, 
                too low level and too complicated to me. i was kinda scared to get into it. but i decided to let my curiosity 
                lead the way and started my journey to learn c anyway. turns out, it really is pretty straight-forward! 
                well at least from lesson one that is. i made some notes!
            </p>
            <p>
                the thing that makes c different from other languages like java or c++ is the manual memory management aspect of it. 
                i'll be honest, i only finished one lesson which covered pointers and basic syntax, but hey that is <em>the topic</em>
                they all talk about when it comes to c and memory management. so let's get on with it.
            </p>

            <p>
                to understand pointers, we need to first understand how memory works, ie., how data from your code is stored in the 
                memory when you run your program. without going too deep, let's look at the two types of memory storage that are relevant 
                here:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>stack</li>
                <li>heap</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                stack-based memory allocation: <br> 
                stack is that region in the memory where local variables and functions are stores. each thread has an independent reserved stack. 
                every time a function is called, it gets placed on the top of the stack until it returns. if a function is called inside another 
                function that is already being executed (such as nested functions or anonymous functions), it gets placed on top of the function 
                that is already running. the function that is on the top of the stack must always return before anything that is under it on the 
                stack. this principle is known as Last-in-First-out (LIFO). LIFO is also a principle used in cost accounting, but fuck if i 
                remember what it actually did. but here it means the last thing to enter the stack must be the first to go out. any variables 
                declared inside the current executing function will only remain in memory while the function is on the stack. once the function 
                has returned, any variables within the local scope will be lost. that means the data is not longer accessible.
