                i mean i studied this in cs5031 software engineering practices, and a lot more than what i am going to 
                document in this here article, but i needed the revision and i love learning, so here is a little bit 
                of an introductory lesson about building maven projects and the importance of unit testing.
            </p>
            <p>
                let's start by talking about what the heck maven even is. maven is a build system that allows you to test 
                your code using testing dependencies such a JUnit. maven builds (compiles) and tests your code for you 
                before you run it so that everything works just as you expect it to as the developer. this is especially 
                useful in ci/cd pipelines in continuous development environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                so how does maven do this? simple answer is, maven reads the <span><pre><code>pom.xml</code></pre></span> file that 
                includes all the dependencies such a jupiter.junit, etc., and depending on whether you've set up your 
                git ci/cd pipelines to do it or you do it manually yourself, maven takes the command to build and compile your project.
            </p>

            <!--TDD-->
            <p>
                so how to go about writing your first tests? <br>
                i really struggled with tdd before i understood this fundamental thing about it: in tdd, you test against an observable 
                user requirement. i used to scratch my head thinking of tests to write before i even knew what i needed to implement when 
                all i had to do was think about what are the user requirements from the user stories. 'as a user i want to xyz' the 'xyz' 
                <em>is</em> what you test!
            </p>

            <p>
                remember to create a special testing constructor if you have specific behaviours to test.
